## Hi, I am Jonathan. ðŸ––

My journey in the tech world began as an iOS developer, where I have published over 20 apps since. 
Currently, I am working as a full-stack developer & head of IT at a company in Berlin, overseeing cloud infrastructure, system planning, and project implementation.

Outside of my day job, I engage in freelance work with a variety of companies, enriching my experience and broadening my expertise. You can learn more about my freelance endeavors at [nosc.io.](https://nosc.io).

I am a proud alumnus of 42 Heilbronn, an innovative educational institution that I highly recommend for its challenging projects and lovely community. Itâ€™s an excellent choice for anyone seeking an unconventional educational pathway.

Since 2018, I have been actively involved in a climate protest movement in Germany, contributing significantly to the digital infrastructure, building custom tools and securing systems.

I am passionate about supporting open, non-profit projects and always happy to lend my skills where they can make a difference.
