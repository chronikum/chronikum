## Hi, I am Jonathan. ðŸ¤˜

Big fan of open source.  
I started as iOS developer with around 20 published apps on iOS and now i am moving becoming a full-stack web-dev.  
Currently working for a startup in berlin and I am a student at 42HN learning about C.

I am always willing to help out open non profit projects!
