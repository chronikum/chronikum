## Hi, I am Jonathan. ðŸ––

Big fan of open source. 
I started as iOS developer with around 20 published apps on iOS and now i am working as a full stack web developer for a company in berlin.

In my spare time, I visit 42HN to learn about C/CPP or report bugs to companies :) 

I am always willing to help out open non profit projects!
